# Trading Competition 2020

Seed repository for the trading competition, with some example projects you can use to get started/

## Overview

The target is to paper-trade on interactive brokers, to make the most money possible before the competition ends.

You can fork this repo, and start testing your ideas and developing a strategy.

You will have to research a trading strategy, do some back-testing then pitch your investment strategy before you can open the paper trading account.

You can then trade on the interactive broker API and build up your fund as large as possible!

## Basic Market Theory

This repo contains 5 basic strategies.  The ultimate aim of the game is to buy low, sell high.  To do this you will most likely need to purchase some kind of financial security that is likely to go up in value in the near future.

There are several reasons this might happen, which are all based on exploiting inefficiencies in the market place.  These are roughly categorised as:

### Asymmetry of information

In an ideal market, everyone has access to the same information.  This would in theory lead everyone to come to a similar conclusion over the value of the asset, and reduce inaccurate pricing.

To understand where this can fail, imagine buying a second hand car.  The owner maybe knows that this car is a piece of junk, but disguises this to make it look like a solid, reliable car.  Not-knowing this information, the buyer can be persuaded into over-paying for an asset which is not worth as much.

Going the other, a highly knowledgeable antique-dealer, maybe at a garage sale and see a very rare and valuable item for sale for $10.  The seller, not knowing it's real value, may be willing to sell it under-priced, so the antique dealer can then take this item to another market where people under-stand it's value and make a profit.

### Inhomogenous goods

Generally speaking, if a good can be easily substituted for another good, it becomes difficult to over-price it.  If someone is trying to sell potatoes for $100 per potato, obviously buyers will just go elsewhere and purchase an equivlanet item (i.e. a substitute) for much less.

However, if for some reason, this is a special potato, that has some special properties not available elsewhere, then the seller may be able to support the inflated valuation, because they have control of the supply of this special potato.

A good example of this is the company Apple, which has managed to convince everyone that their products are somehow special and so people are willing to pay over-the-odds for them.  The result being that Apple is one of the most cash-rich companies of all time.

### Limited Suppliers or Buyers

If you don't have lots and lots of other sellers in the marketplace, you end up with what's called an 'oligopoly' (i.e. a few large suppliers, like supermarkets for instance), or a 'monopoly' where there is only one supplier of the good

An interesting example of this is the copper-man, who attempted to control the entire world's supply of copper in order to charge above it's real value to make money.

Ultimately his attempt to create a monopoly failed, but it's an interesting example nonetheless - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumitomo_copper_affair

You can also flip it the other way, if you are the only person purchasing in a market place, you can push the price down.  Supermarkets do this well to bully their suppliers on price, since they purchase the majority of milk for example, the farmers have little choice but to accept whatever price they are offered by the supermarkets

### Barriers to entry

If you have an inefficient market, where someone is making abnormally high profits, you'd expect that someone else would notice, and come in and under-cut them to take a slice of the pie.

You'd expect over time that as more suppliers enter the market, and under-cutting each other, that prices would return to normal levels.

Of course, if there are high barriers to entry into this market place (either large capital investment required, or intense legal regulation, eg setting up a bank), then other sellers cannot come in and undercut and the existing players in the marketplace continue to benefit from charging abnormally high prices

## Some example strategies

So now I will cover some examples of strategies you could use to take advantage of these things, in some different markets
